# Predicting Property Sales Prices Using the Random Forest Regression Model
When determining the price of a landed property, the proximity to certain high profile areas and utilities can tremendously increase their value. In this task, I will be building a model to predict the cost of certain properties.

The dataset given includes a collection of features about each property's surrounding neighbourhood, and some features that are constant across each sub area (known as a Raion). Most of the feature names are self explanatory.
